Clone or pull all of a user's Bitbucket repositories to a local directory


## Dependencies

* This utility was tested against Bash v5
* The JSON-processor `jq` is required
* Both SCM executables `git` and `hg` are assumed to have been installed and configured
* (You also _must_ have `curl` and `pushd` -- right?!)
